# Welcome to Strava ScratchMap!

Access the web application here: https://a-stan004.github.io/StravaScratchmap

# About the application

This application is **not affiliated with Strava** but uses the Strava API to allow you to make a scratchmap style map of your routes! No information is stored outside of your browser, or sent to any external resource.

## The login process

The login process is explained on the page but if you want to know more read here:

You need to create yourself an application instance within your Strava account first. This is done from the www.strava.com/settings/api page. The details can be anything you wish.
You then provide the Client ID from your account, to authenticate the app. This results in a page failed to load. **This failed to load page is normal**. You then take the code from the URL returned and enter it into the next screen, along with your client ID. And that's it! You're ready to view your routes.

## Scratching a route

Scratching out a route is as simple as clicking on a coin!
